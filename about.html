<h1>The Authoress</h1>
<p>
    Ellen is a librarian from North Carolina. She pretends she knows more about computers than she actually does. 
    She obtained her Bachelor's (BA in Global Studies, French) from UNC, ran away to teach English in France, worked in a bookstore, and finally settled down to become a librarian (MSLS also from UNC).

    Her previous attempts to document her life may be found below:

<br>
<p>She is also a shameless cat lover and mercilessly seeks any possible way to insert cats into her work.</p>
