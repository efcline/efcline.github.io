<h1>The Authoress</h1>
<p>
    Ellen is an MSLS grad student from Durham, North Carolina. She pretends she knows more about computers than she actually does. Nevertheless, she is happy to be back in Chapel Hill! 
    She obtained her Bachelor's (BA in Global Studies, French) from UNC, ran away to teach English in France, worked in a bookstore, and finally decided she wants to be a librarian only last year.

<p>She is also a shameless cat lover and mercilessly seeks any possible way to insert cats into her work.</p>
