Sometimes in class we learn stuff really fast! Often I am working diligently on a project, go to add a change, and find myself confronted with an unhappy message:

> `fatal: pathspec '_config.yml' did not match any files`

Oh no! What idiotic thing have I messed up this time? 

Instead of panicking or getting frustrated, I usually use a few basic commands to help me understand the error.
A simple `pwd` command tells me where I am (am I trying to add from the wrong directory?) `ls` reminds me of the files and extra things contained in that working directory (did I not name the file correctly when I went to add?), and a `cd` will, eventually, get me there and capable of adding and commiting a change.
Not only are these basic, easy commands that are good for every user to know, they restore my confidence in myself and my ability to navigate the strange seas of computers and coding and text!

The best way to go about it is practice, practice, practice. After all, *repetitio est mater studiorum* (my father always translated this differently as "repetition is the mother of memory" but "study" works just as well).

So, what have we learned in class? 

Things learned | Thoughts
---------------------- | -------------------------
Web structure basics | Makes sense now!
Cloud9, GitHub | Where were these resources when I was first learning about how websites are made? Either just created/not created yet.
HTML, CSS, Markdown | Markdown is **fabulous** although I still have to delete all the stubborn html junk from my brain and replace it with superior tools.

Things I should do:

* Read more tutorials
    * Here is a good one for [jekyll in general](http://jekyllrb.com/) 
    * The [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) are great too
    * Markdown help [found here](http://dillinger.io/)
* Code more often
* Ask when unsure

I also think that Neal Stephenson's _In the Beginning was the Command Line_ is amazing and should be read by any and all people interested in computers. You can read it for free [here](http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html).

After all, even though I am not an avid Gilmore Girls fan, Rory has the meat of the nut here:
