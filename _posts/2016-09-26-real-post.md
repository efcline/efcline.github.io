Sometimes in class we learn stuff really fast! I find it is best to reorient myself with a few basic commands. Often I go to add a change and find myself confronted with an unfriendly `fatal: pathspec '_config.yml' did not match any files` message. 
Clearly, I am in the wrong directory! A simple `pwd` command tells me where I am, `ls` reminds me of the files and extra things contained in my working directory, and a `cd` will, eventually, get me there and capable of adding and commiting a change.
Not only are these basic commands that are good for every user to know, they restore my confidence in myself and my ability to navigate the strange seas of computers and coding and text!
