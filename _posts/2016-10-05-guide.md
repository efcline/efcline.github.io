Hey! How do I use this thing?

Quite simple, my friend:


 * To read an entire post, not just the short preview, click on the title of the post while on the home page.
 * To learn about the writer, click on the assorted icons beneath the image in the sidebar, or...
 * Navigating around the site: simply head over to the navbar in the upper right corner of the page marked by the <i class="fa fa-bars" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon, click on it, and pick a page! The "About" page will give you info on the authoress, "Categories" and "Tags" break down the posts for your specified reading, and "Hobbies" is a center for reading, surfing the net, and general fun.
  

Enjoy!
