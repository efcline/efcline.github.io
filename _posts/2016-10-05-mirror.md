# Welcome!

The [Mirror Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_Universe), as introduced by the wonderful _Star Trek_ is a parallel universe in which:
>The characters...are aggressive, mistrustful, and opportunistic... [There is a] human-dominated authoritarian Terran Empire which values war, despotism, and conquest [above all].

Clearly, an evil mirror image of our typically heroic Star Trek friends!
The Mirror Universe has become something of a trope in the sci-fi world...for example, often the (evil!) parallel universe versions of favorite characters are depicted with goatees (much like Spock in the Mirrorverse episodes). 


In honor of Trekkies and SF fans everywhere, the colors have been changed here, and the posts on this branch are all have their titles altered or have somehow become evil mirrors of their original selves (all found on the master branch).
