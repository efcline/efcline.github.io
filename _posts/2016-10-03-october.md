This week your intrepid blogger went to an intro to 3D printing event, hosted at UNC's very own Kenan Science Library!

I have some experience with 3D Printing (mostly watching while friends and colleagues model and print things), but I had never actually had a basic overview of the process presented to me. It was a great experience, and I highly recommend it to any and all interested in makerspaces, 3D printing, the University Libraries, and more!

In a nutshell, one takes a model of an object created using programs like [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) or select one already made in databases like [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/), and feeds it into a printer.
It is important that the designs be watertight or have some method of support and have no negative space! Otherwise they may not print correctly or collapse under their own weight. 
Once a design is chosen, it needs to be converted into an .stl file, thus making it printable. There are many sites which can perform this duty, for example [3Dtransform](http://www.3dtransform.com/).
There are many different types of 3D printers, from the [very fancy](http://www.stratasys.com/3d-printers/idea-series/uprint-se) to the [beginner friendly](http://us.xyzprinting.com/). Different printers print in different ways!
Some use a system of fused filament fabrication, taking material and extruding it onto a plate, while others use light, lasers, and stereolithography to perform a similar task! Models can be made with anything from plastic polymers to metals.
Most printers print in layers of .2mm, laying one on top of the other until the model is finished! Kenan Science Library has a great collection of models printed in the makerspace - everything from toy elephants (who can move their legs and heads!) to complicated protein polymers.

The only drawback of 3D printing is the cost. True, it does take time (some can take over 24 hours to fully print) but considering the educational potential of such material, I think the hours required to print quickly prove themselves.
Cost, though, can run fairly high. Even the plastic used to print the cheapest of models can run up to $40 or $50 per kg. Precious metals (gold, platinum) can of course be much more pricey. And the printers themselves don't come cheap.
Fortunately, many libraries (including Durham County Library!) are purchasing printers for public use, allowing patrons to use them free of cost!
